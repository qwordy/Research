\section{Introduction}
Concurrent programs are pervasive in nowadays software development activities. However, concurrent programs are known hard to write correctly for multiple threads accessing objects simultaneously or depending on each other usually need complex synchronization and hard to debug for the uncertainty of thread interleaving which makes it difficult to reproduce the bug. Developers struggle with various of synchronization methods and subtle concurrent bugs.

Benefit

However, this work has to face several challenges:

\textbf{Challenge 1} 

Research shows that software modifications are usually similar but not identical.


Our main contributions are:

The rest of paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the methodology of our study. Section 3 presents our result and discussion. Section 4 presents related work. Section 5 presents future work and Section 6 concludes.

\section{Methodology}
This section presents the project sources of our study, research questions and methods of doing the study. We have  developed a tool supporting the empirical study.

\subsection{Project Sources} We investigate 8 Java open-source projects from Github including Hadoop, Tomcat, Cassandra, Lucene-solr, Netty, Flink, Guava and Mahout as shown in Table 1. They are all popular, large-scale, active, representative Java open-source projects and cover different areas like distributed computing, web server, database, information retrieval, I/O and machine learning. For example, the Hadoop project develops open-source software for reliable, scalable, distributed computing and has become one of the most famous Java open-source software for many years. Tomcat is the most popular implementation of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Expression Language and Java WebSocket technologies. Cassandra is a database system which can Manage massive amounts of data, fast, without losing sleep. Table 1 shows the lines of code in Java, the number of Java files and the number of commits of each project. All the projects are checked out for our study in November 2016.

\subsection{Research questions}
In order to understand the evolution of concurrent code better, we proposed 3 research questions:

\textbf{RQ1.} How frequent do concurrent related code modification appear in different kind of Java open-source projects?

Concurrent programming is very popular in today's Java development with the rapid developments of multi-core techniques which help exploit the power of concurrent programming. Java programming language provides convenient built-in concurrent libraries and users can also invoke third-party libraries. We want to know how frequent do concurrent related code change in different kind of repositories.

\textbf{RQ2.} What is the trend of certain concurrent program construct?

\textbf{RQ3.} Is there any change pattern in concurrent related code?

\textbf{RQ4.} How can similar code changes in history guide the new modification in development?

\subsection{Methods}
All the projects of our study are under git which is one of the most popular version control systems in the world. Some projects of the study used svn or some other version control systems before because they have long histories, but they all support git now. We employ JGit, a  lightweight, pure java library implementation of git, to retrieve all the commit logs in projects' histories. A typical commit log contains commit id which is a 20-character-long string uniquely identifying a commit, author, date and message. Once we get a commit id, we use "git show" command to show the log message and textual diff. The diff result contains one or more change files which contain one or more change hunks.

\subsection{Collecting code snippets}
\subsubsection{Checking out versions}
All the projects of our study are under git which is one of the most popular version control systems in the world. We first use "git diff-tree --no-commit-id --name-status -r <commitId>" command to get changed file list of each commit. For each Java source file in the list, we use "git checkout <commitId> -- <filename>" and "git checkout <commitId> \^ -- <filename>" command to check out the old version before the commit and the new version after the commit. Then we extract matching methods of two files base on method name and list of its arguments.

Method-level unit is chosen as the unit of code snippets in our study because file-level unit is too large, whose intrinsic code correlation is not as compact as smaller code unit and which probably contains noises of multiple uncorrelated modifications. More fine-grained level of unit like a group of continuous statements has higher precision and correlation with the modification but is more difficult to identify and implement. Therefore, method-level unit is a practical choice. 

\subsubsection{Preprocessing}
Pairs of methods extracted need to be preprocessed. Noticing that a Java class usually has more codes which are mostly class variable declarations outside method definitions, we rewrite the methods to make them more complete without losing the type information defined in the class. We copy a variable declaration into a method if it is referenced in this method. If a local variable in method and a class variable have the same identifiers, the class variable will be renamed to solve the conflict problem. Figure 1 shows an example from .

\subsubsection{Selecting concurrent related snippets}
After we have pairs of code snippets to be further analysed, we present how we select concurrent related snippets. Concurrent related code is a semantic concept. There are too many third-party libraries and user-defined classes that have concurrent related functionalities. So it is hard to select concurrent related code precisely. We use a naive but effective keyword matching method.

A concurrent keyword here is defined as one of the class names or interface names of Java concurrent package and some other concurrent related keywords in Java like 'synchronize' and 'Thread'. Java concurrent package is a common-used concurrent libraries which provide many useful features. It is introduced into Java standard library since Java 1.5. We define a concurrent related snippet as a snippet which contains a concurrent keyword. A pair of snippets is concurrent related if any snippet of the pair is concurrent related. We traverse all the pairs of snippets and reserve those which are concurrent related.

A string matching algorithm is used to check if a snippet contains a concurrent keyword. A keyword sometimes is not at the position which it should be. For example, a type name occurs in a string or a comment. But now that the keyword exists in the code for some reasons, the code tend to has some relationships with concurrency more or less. This method might omit some snippets that are concurrent related, but the selected ones are mostly concurrent related snippets indeed. So, string matching algorithm is acceptable and practical.

We first identify the Java code of a commit log.

\subsection{Classification}
Most of the commits selected by the last step are not our targets since they usually add or modify functionalities  which are specific although they contain some concurrent keywords. The target commits to be analysed occupy a very small proportion of all the commits even we have already filtered them. So, we need some automatic methods to help finish the job.

We use the SVM method to classify commits as concurrent-related or not. SVM is a supervised classification algorithm which needs both positive and negative training data. We extracted 12 features from each commit and labeled 65 instances manually as a training data set. Testing on the training set itself has an accuracy of 98.46\%. The classifier selects 96 positive instances from 9891 instances.

\subsection{Extracting changes}
We employ a tree based differencing algorithm to extract code changes of matching methods. For a matching pair of methods before and after a modification, the differencing algorithm generates a sequence of edit operations. An edit operation is one of the following types:

\textbf{Insert}

\textbf{Delete}

\textbf{Update}

We give some definitions first.

\newdef{def1}{Definition}
\begin{def1}
Two nodes are exact matching if their 
\end{def1}

We traverse the two ASTs of a pair of snippets using a pre-order search and compare the corresponding nodes.


\subsection{Calculating similarity}
The code similarity has two aspects: context similarity and change similarity. Detecting similar code snippets can use code clone detection techniques. Code clone detection approaches can be categorised into four main categories \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/Onuoha16}, namely, text or string based approach, lexical or token based approach, tree based approach and semantic approach.

\subsubsection{Grouping}
Comparing each code snippet with each other cost too much time which is in an order of \begin{math}O(n^2) \end{math} where n is the number of snippets. We narrow the search space of clone detection by grouping snippets fast by keyword. The groups are not orthometric. It is not classification. A pair snippet may belong to multiple groups. For example, a group consists of all pairs which contain keyword $k$.

\subsubsection{Extracting change-related context}
We use data dependency analysis to keep only nearly code which has relationship with the changes.

\subsubsection{Context similarity}
A context is several neighbour statements of change locations. We take the original code that will be changed into consideration.  
 
We employ a tree based code clone detecting approach to detect similar code snippets.

We apply machine learning techniques to classify code snippets.
\subsubsection{Change similarity}

\textbf{Prepare snippet pairs}
Java concurrent package is a common-used concurrent libraries which provide many practical features. We use class name and interface name of the package to selected more than 100000+ concurrent related program snippets modification pairs from 8 popular projects from github. If a program snippet contains any class or interface from java concurrent package, it is considered as a concurrent related program snippet.

\textbf{Clustering}
We believe that similar program pieces tend to have some similar changes in commit histories. Program pieces are clustered into several group based on concurrent keywords which are class name and interface name from the java concurrent package and 'synchronize'. We use a tfidf model to build a numeric vector for each snippet then employ weka clustering tools including kmeans and em algorithms to cluster the extracted snippets.

\textbf{Collecting code snippets} Prepare a database of concurrent related pair of code snippets. A pair means the original code and modified code.

\textbf{Extracting changes} Extract changes of pair of code snippets. Changes consist of a sequence of edit operations like insert, delete and update.

\textbf{Calculating similarity} 

\section{Results}

use readlock instead of synchronized block
use new class in jdk7 ThreadLocalRandom
guava cache or jdk concurrenthashmap
atomicinteger, atomiclong, synchronized

replace one-shot lock w/ synchronized block
use CallerRunsPolicy instead of rejecting runnables on multi-threaded executors w/ blocking queues
Replace synchronization in Gossiper with concurrent data structures and volatile fields
switch singleton implementation from double-checked-locking to synchronized (code is not performance-sensitive)
use ConcurrentHashMap to simplify ugly loop (normal HashMap you cannot delete from during iteration)
volatile should ensure double locking to work properly
Changed Counters to use ConcurrentSkipListMap for performance
Use ThreadLocalRandom where possible

3641 Code was used although I can't see why a simple AtomicInteger wasn't sufficient.

Double checked locking is a synchronization pattern in software engineering. It first check the condition without lock to reduce the time overhead when the condition is not satisfied. A typical usage of it is singleton pattern which uses lazy initialization to provide an unique instance during the process execution time in multi-threaded scenario. But sometimes programmers make some mistakes using this pattern like forgetting 'volatile' modifier of the member of object in Java.

Concurrent data structures provide convenience for concurrent programming without caring about complicated thread-safe problems. So many commits turn to use these well-written libraries instead of synchronize on their own.

AtomicIntegerFieldUpdater 

ThreadLocalRandom is combination of ThreadLocal and Random. 

\subsection{Implications}
This research provides some implications from different kinds of perspectives.

(1) Developers are facing more and more concurrent programming requirements now. But concurrent programming is notoriously error-prone because of the complexity of data synchronization and thread interleaving. Our study gives developers some guidelines of writing concurrent programs. First, use handy concurrent libraries to finish the job instead of rewrite them by yourself unless all the available concurrent libraries cannot satisfy your requirement and you are absolutely confident of your comcurrent programming skills. Using existing libraries allows you to  write less code to finish the same work and enjoy the high quality of implementation which is always reliable, strong and fast.

(2) Automatic tools are needed to help developers inspect and revise concurrent programs. There has already been some tools, but they

\section{Future work}
We have learned that similar code changes of concurrent related code are common in history of software evolution. This indicates some automatic tools may help developers maintain their code.

\section{Introduction}

The \textit{proceedings} are the records of a conference.
ACM seeks to give these conference by-products a uniform,
high-quality appearance.  To do this, ACM has some rigid
requirements for the format of the proceedings documents: there
is a specified format (balanced  double columns), a specified
set of fonts (Arial or Helvetica and Times Roman) in
certain specified sizes (for instance, 9 point for body copy),
a specified live area (18 $\times$ 23.5 cm [7" $\times$ 9.25"]) centered on
the page, specified size of margins (1.9 cm [0.75"]) top, (2.54 cm [1"]) bottom
and (1.9 cm [.75"]) left and right; specified column width
(8.45 cm [3.33"]) and gutter size (.83 cm [.33"]).

The good news is, with only a handful of manual
settings\footnote{Two of these, the {\texttt{\char'134 numberofauthors}}
and {\texttt{\char'134 alignauthor}} commands, you have
already used; another, {\texttt{\char'134 balancecolumns}}, will
be used in your very last run of \LaTeX\ to ensure
balanced column heights on the last page.}, the \LaTeX\ document
class file handles all of this for you.

The remainder of this document is concerned with showing, in
the context of an ``actual'' document, the \LaTeX\ commands
specifically available for denoting the structure of a
proceedings paper, rather than with giving rigorous descriptions
or explanations of such commands.

\section{The {\secit Body} of The Paper}
Typically, the body of a paper is organized
into a hierarchical structure, with numbered or unnumbered
headings for sections, subsections, sub-subsections, and even
smaller sections.  The command \texttt{{\char'134}section} that
precedes this paragraph is part of such a
hierarchy.\footnote{This is the second footnote.  It
starts a series of three footnotes that add nothing
informational, but just give an idea of how footnotes work
and look. It is a wordy one, just so you see
how a longish one plays out.} \LaTeX\ handles the numbering
and placement of these headings for you, when you use
the appropriate heading commands around the titles
of the headings.  If you want a sub-subsection or
smaller part to be unnumbered in your output, simply append an
asterisk to the command name.  Examples of both
numbered and unnumbered headings will appear throughout the
balance of this sample document.

Because the entire article is contained in
the \textbf{document} environment, you can indicate the
start of a new paragraph with a blank line in your
input file; that is why this sentence forms a separate paragraph.

\subsection{Type Changes and {\subsecit Special} Characters}
We have already seen several typeface changes in this sample.  You
can indicate italicized words or phrases in your text with
the command \texttt{{\char'134}textit}; emboldening with the
command \texttt{{\char'134}textbf}
and typewriter-style (for instance, for computer code) with
\texttt{{\char'134}texttt}.  But remember, you do not
have to indicate typestyle changes when such changes are
part of the \textit{structural} elements of your
article; for instance, the heading of this subsection will
be in a sans serif\footnote{A third footnote, here.
Let's make this a rather short one to
see how it looks.} typeface, but that is handled by the
document class file. Take care with the use
of\footnote{A fourth, and last, footnote.}
the curly braces in typeface changes; they mark
the beginning and end of
the text that is to be in the different typeface.

You can use whatever symbols, accented characters, or
non-English characters you need anywhere in your document;
you can find a complete list of what is
available in the \textit{\LaTeX\
User's Guide}\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

\subsection{Math Equations}
You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of
the three are discussed in the next sections.

\subsubsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
A formula that appears in the running text is called an
inline or in-text formula.  It is produced by the
\textbf{math} environment, which can be
invoked with the usual \texttt{{\char'134}begin. . .{\char'134}end}
construction or with the short form \texttt{\$. . .\$}. You
can use any of the symbols and structures,
from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a
few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how
this equation: \begin{math}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{math},
set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsubsection{Display Equations}
A numbered display equation -- one set off by vertical space
from the text and centered horizontally -- is produced
by the \textbf{equation} environment. An unnumbered display
equation is produced by the \textbf{displaymath} environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
and structures available in \LaTeX; this section will just
give a couple of examples of display equations in context.
First, consider the equation, shown as an inline equation above:
\begin{equation}\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0\end{equation}
Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
the \textbf{displaymath}
environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
\begin{displaymath}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1\end{displaymath}
and follow it with another numbered equation:
\begin{equation}\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f\end{equation}
just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

\subsection{Citations}
Citations to articles \cite{bowman:reasoning,
clark:pct, braams:babel, herlihy:methodology},
conference proceedings \cite{clark:pct} or
books \cite{salas:calculus, Lamport:LaTeX} listed
in the Bibliography section of your
article will occur throughout the text of your article.
You should use BibTeX to automatically produce this bibliography;
you simply need to insert one of several citation commands with
a key of the item cited in the proper location in
the \texttt{.tex} file \cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.
The key is a short reference you invent to uniquely
identify each work; in this sample document, the key is
the first author's surname and a
word from the title.  This identifying key is included
with each item in the \texttt{.bib} file for your article.

The details of the construction of the \texttt{.bib} file
are beyond the scope of this sample document, but more
information can be found in the \textit{Author's Guide},
and exhaustive details in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's
Guide}\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

This article shows only the plainest form
of the citation command, using \texttt{{\char'134}cite}.
This is what is stipulated in the SIGS style specifications.
No other citation format is endorsed or supported.

\subsection{Tables}
Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best
placement for them is typically the top of the page
nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go
in the \textbf{tabular} environment, to
be aligned properly in rows and columns, with the desired
horizontal and vertical rules.  Again, detailed instructions
on \textbf{tabular} material
is found in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 1 is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed
dvi output of this document.

\begin{table}
\centering
\caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\ \hline
\O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\ \hline
$\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\ \hline
\$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\ \hline
$\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
\hline\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of
the page's live area, use the environment
\textbf{table*} to enclose the table's contents and
the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this wide
table will ``float" to a location deemed more desirable.
Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table 2 is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the
table here with the table in the printed dvi
output of this document.


\begin{table*}

\caption{Some Typical Commands}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline

\texttt{{\char'134}alignauthor} & 100& Author alignment\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}numberofauthors}& 200& Author enumeration\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\ \hline
\texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\ \hline\end{tabular}
\end{table*}
% end the environment with {table*}, NOTE not {table}!

\subsection{Figures}
Like tables, figures cannot be split across pages; the
best placement for them
is typically the top or the bottom of the page nearest
their initial cite.  To ensure this proper ``floating'' placement
of figures, use the environment
\textbf{figure} to enclose the figure and its caption.

This sample document contains examples of \textbf{.eps} files to be
displayable with \LaTeX.  If you work with pdf\LaTeX, use files in the
\textbf{.pdf} format.  Note that most modern \TeX\ system will convert
\textbf{.eps} to \textbf{.pdf} for you on the fly.  More details on
each of these is found in the \textit{Author's Guide}.

\centering
\includegraphics[height=1in, width=1in]{fly}
\caption{A sample black and white graphic
that has been resized with the \texttt{includegraphics} command.}
\end{figure}


As was the case with tables, you may want a figure
that spans two columns.  To do this, and still to
ensure proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the environment
\textbf{figure*} to enclose the figure and its caption.
and don't forget to end the environment with
{figure*}, not {figure}!

that needs to span two columns of text.}

\subsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
Other common constructs that may occur in your article are
the forms for logical constructs like theorems, axioms,
corollaries and proofs.  There are
two forms, one produced by the
command \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} and the
other by the command \texttt{{\char'134}newdef}; perhaps
the clearest and easiest way to distinguish them is
to compare the two in the output of this sample document:

This uses the \textbf{theorem} environment, created by
the\linebreak\texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} command:
\newtheorem{theorem}{Theorem}
\begin{theorem}
Let $f$ be continuous on $[a,b]$.  If $G$ is
an antiderivative for $f$ on $[a,b]$, then
\begin{displaymath}\int^b_af(t)dt = G(b) - G(a).\end{displaymath}
\end{theorem}

The other uses the \textbf{definition} environment, created
by the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command:
\newdef{definition}{Definition}
\begin{definition}
If $z$ is irrational, then by $e^z$ we mean the
unique number which has
logarithm $z$: \begin{displaymath}{\log e^z = z}\end{displaymath}
\end{definition}

Two lists of constructs that use one of these
forms is given in the
\textit{Author's  Guidelines}.
 
There is one other similar construct environment, which is
already set up
for you; i.e. you must \textit{not} use
a \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to
create it: the \textbf{proof} environment.  Here
is a example of its use:
\begin{proof}
Suppose on the contrary there exists a real number $L$ such that
\begin{displaymath}
\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = L.
\end{displaymath}
Then
\begin{displaymath}
l=\lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\left[ g{x} \cdot \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} \right ]
= \lim_{x\rightarrow c} g(x) \cdot \lim_{x\rightarrow c}
\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = 0\cdot L = 0,
\end{displaymath}
which contradicts our assumption that $l\neq 0$.
\end{proof}

Complete rules about using these environments and using the
two different creation commands are in the
\textit{Author's Guide}; please consult it for more
detailed instructions.  If you need to use another construct,
not listed therein, which you want to have the same
formatting as the Theorem
or the Definition\cite{salas:calculus} shown above,
use the \texttt{{\char'134}newtheorem} or the
\texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command,
respectively, to create it.

\subsection*{A {\secit Caveat} for the \TeX\ Expert}
Because you have just been given permission to
use the \texttt{{\char'134}newdef} command to create a
new form, you might think you can
use \TeX's \texttt{{\char'134}def} to create a
new command: \textit{Please refrain from doing this!}
Remember that your \LaTeX\ source code is primarily intended
to create camera-ready copy, but may be converted
to other forms -- e.g. HTML. If you inadvertently omit
some or all of the \texttt{{\char'134}def}s recompilation will
be, to say the least, problematic.

\section{Conclusions}
This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.
Remember that you might still have Acknowledgments or
Appendices; brief samples of these
follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and
we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception
of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in
this paper are to articles which have nothing to
do with the present subject and are used as
examples only.

%ACKNOWLEDGMENTS are optional
\section{Acknowledgments}
This section is optional; it is a location for you
to acknowledge grants, funding, editing assistance and
what have you.  In the present case, for example, the
authors would like to thank Gerald Murray of ACM for
his help in codifying this \textit{Author's Guide}
and the \textbf{.cls} and \textbf{.tex} files that it describes.

% The following two commands are all you need in the
% initial runs of your .tex file to
% produce the bibliography for the citations in your paper.
\bibliographystyle{abbrv}
\bibliography{sigproc}  % sigproc.bib is the name of the Bibliography in this case
% You must have a proper ".bib" file

\section{Headings in Appendices}
The rules about hierarchical headings discussed above for
the body of the article are different in the appendices.
In the \textbf{appendix} environment, the command
\textbf{section} is used to
indicate the start of each Appendix, with alphabetic order
designation (i.e. the first is A, the second B, etc.) and
a title (if you include one).  So, if you need
hierarchical structure
\textit{within} an Appendix, start with \textbf{subsection} as the
highest level. Here is an outline of the body of this
document in Appendix-appropriate form:
\subsection{Introduction}
\subsection{The Body of the Paper}
\subsubsection{Type Changes and  Special Characters}
\subsubsection{Math Equations}
\paragraph{Inline (In-text) Equations}
\paragraph{Display Equations}
\subsubsection{Citations}
\subsubsection{Tables}
\subsubsection{Figures}
\subsubsection{Theorem-like Constructs}
\subsubsection*{A Caveat for the \TeX\ Expert}
\subsection{Conclusions}
\subsection{Acknowledgments}
\subsection{Additional Authors}
This section is inserted by \LaTeX; you do not insert it.
You just add the names and information in the
\texttt{{\char'134}additionalauthors} command at the start
of the document.
\subsection{References}
Generated by bibtex from your ~.bib file.  Run latex,
then bibtex, then latex twice (to resolve references)
to create the ~.bbl file.  Insert that ~.bbl file into
the .tex source file and comment out
the command \texttt{{\char'134}thebibliography}.
% This next section command marks the start of
% Appendix B, and does not continue the present hierarchy
\section{More Help for the Hardy}
The sig-alternate.cls file itself is chock-full of succinct
and helpful comments.  If you consider yourself a moderately
experienced to expert user of \LaTeX, you may find reading
it useful but please remember not to change it.
