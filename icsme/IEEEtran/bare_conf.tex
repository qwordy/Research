\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
Concurrent programs are pervasive in nowadays software development activities. Using concurrency rightly in programs can exploit the calculation ability better with the rapid development of multi-core system. However, concurrent programming is very hard \cite{journals/corr/McKenney17},\cite{journals/queue/SutterL05} because multiple threads, which access objects simultaneously or depend on each other, usually need complex synchronization and it is hard to debug concurrent programs for the uncertainty of thread interleaving which makes it difficult to reproduce the bug. Developers often struggle with various of synchronization methods and subtle concurrent bugs. There are much research about concurrent programming in the literature such as concurrency bug detection \cite{conf/pldi/FlanaganF09},\cite{conf/kbse/KroeningPSW16},\cite{conf/pldi/FlanaganFY08}, concurrent programming model \cite{conf/java/Lea00},\cite{conf/oopsla/Bagherzadeh15} and empirical work \cite{conf/sosp/DavidGT13}.

Rui Gu et al \cite{conf/sigsoft/GuJSZL15} studied change history of thread synchronization. They focus on how critical sections are changed and how the changes solve performance problems and correctness problems. However, concurrency is not only reflected by critical sections, but also some other programming constructs like concurrent libirary usage, thread management. Gustavo Pinto et al \cite{journals/jss/PintoTFFB15} did a large-scale study on the usage of Java’s concurrent programming constructs. They investigated in a static view, but we would like to do it in a dynamic view - program changes.

Software projects evolves during years because of new functionalities, bugs, reorganization of code. A few of open source software platforms like github has been more and more popular in recent years. They hold a huge amount of software projects and their historic versions. Researchers have shown that software evolution history can provide much useful information for today's software development activities. Many studies focus on topics of software evolution such as refactoring, transformation patterns. Gustavo Santos et al \cite{conf/icsm/SantosAEDV15} studied system specific, source code transformations. However, the change patterns of concurrent programs are less studied.

We studied concurrent programs from a perspective of software evolution history and found many change patterns about concurrent programming. Understanding concurrent program change patterns is very beneficial.

(1) Developers are facing many concurrent programming requirements now. But concurrent programming is notoriously error-prone because of the complexity of data synchronization and thread interleaving. Our study gives developers some guidelines of writing concurrent programs. First, use handy concurrent libraries to finish the job instead of rewrite them by yourself unless all the available concurrent libraries cannot satisfy your requirement and you are absolutely confident of your comcurrent programming skills. Using existing libraries allows you to  write less code to finish the same work and enjoy the high quality of implementation which is always reliable, strong and fast. Second, always switch to new-version libraries because they usually provide higher performance and robustness.

(2) Automatic tools are needed to help developers inspect and revise concurrent programs with the help of history information. They can learn from existing change patterns. There has already been some tools, but they usually look for concurrent bugs such as race detection, deadlock detection and atomicity violation without considering software evolution history. Both project specific and project independent transformation patterns exist in real-world software projects. So we need some concurrent code refactoring tools to give advice of what code need change and perform the transformations automatically. It is a chance for IDE manufacturer to make the IDE more intelligent in inspecting and modifying the code. Developers will benefit a lot if such kind of automatic tools can actually help them automate their development and maintaining activities.

However, this work has to face several challenges:

(1) The scale of open source software is increasing explosively as a result of some open source code platforms have become more and more popular. The change history of the open source software is also vast. Our interest is concurrent related commit, but they are hidden in the massive commit history. It requires much time and effort to identify whether a commit is concurrent related or not if doing it manually. We would like to adopt some automatic methods. Simple keyword matching algorithm will not work well because some commits just add or remove functionalities rather than modify original code.

(2) The changes of code usually have complex relationship with the context not only in the file where change happens but also other files. Some change patterns have implicit dependency on the existing code. This raises a challenge to identify real change patterns which can be applied to other context correctly.

Our main contributions are:

(1) We identify and classify change patterns in concurrent programs and observe some interesting findings.

(2) We adopt some change patterns to real software projects and our requests are accepted.

(3) We give some inspirations to concurrent program or library developers and analysis tool developers.

The rest of paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the methodology of our study. Section 3 presents our result and discussion. Section 4 presents related work. Section 5 presents future work and Section 6 concludes.

\section{Methodology}
This section presents data set of our study, research questions and tool support.

\subsection{Data set} We investigate 8 Java open-source projects from Github including Hadoop, Tomcat, Cassandra, Lucene-solr, Netty, Flink, Guava and Mahout as shown in Table 1. They are all popular, large-scale, active, representative Java open-source projects and cover different areas like distributed computing, web server, database, information retrieval, I/O and machine learning. The Hadoop project develops open-source software for reliable, scalable, distributed computing and has become one of the most famous Java open-source software for many years. Tomcat is the most popular implementation of the Java Servlet, JavaServer Pages, Java Expression Language and Java WebSocket technologies. Cassandra is a database system which can Manage massive amounts of data, fast, without losing sleep. Lucene-solr is two projects together in one respository in Github. Lucene is a search engine library and solr is a search engine server which uses lucene. Netty is an event-driven asynchronous network application framework. Flink is an open source stream processing framework with powerful stream- and batch-processing capabilities. Mahout is a machine learning project. Table I shows the lines of code in Java, the number of Java files and the number of commits of each project. All the projects are checked out for our study in December 2016.

\subsection{Research questions}
In order to understand the evolution of concurrent code and guide the future development better, we proposed 4 research questions:

\textbf{RQ1.} What are change patterns in concurrent programming?

Similar changes of code can be abstracted into change patterns. Some change patterns are project-specific while others are global, which can be considered as knowledge. Developers made numerous commits to the project repository during software's whole lifetime. There are a great many change patterns in software history. On the other hand, concurrent programming is very popular in today's Java development with the rapid developments of multi-core techniques which help exploit the power of concurrent programming. It is very meaningful to understand change patterns in concurrent programming. What are these change patterns and how many types of these change patterns are there?

\textbf{RQ2.} How frequent do concurrent related code modification appear in different kinds of Java open-source projects?

Java programming language provides convenient built-in concurrent libraries and users can also invoke third-party libraries like Apache Commons and Guava, which are both very famous libraries providing reusable conponents. Although developers can use their own concurrent related classes or third-party libraries, they are always using the facilities provided by Java standard libraries in most cases except they are facing special and rigour requirement. We want to know how frequent do concurrent related code change occur in software projects. What are the differences of frequency in different kinds of software projects?

\textbf{RQ3.} What is the trend of concurrent programming construct usage statistically?

Java programming language offers many handy facilities for building concurrent programs. For example, language level constructs like synchronized and volatile are keywords of Java.  There are also API level constructs like notify method of an object and some concurrent related convenient classes such as the java.util.concurrent package. There are always more than one ways to finish a task in Java and the preferences of developers evolves fast. We are interested in  the trend of some common concurrent related constructs and the reasons hidden behind the phenomenon.

\textbf{RQ4.} How can these change patterns in history guide the future development?

In order to better demonstrate these change patterns can really help developers understand concurrent programming practice and apply the practice to their projects, we are going to find the appropriate context in open-source projects and pull requests of applying the change patterns. We are insterested to see that how developers will accept our code change suggestions.

\subsection{Tool support}
We have developed a tool to collect and analyze data. The tool has the following parts.

\subsubsection{Collecting commits}
All the projects of our study are under git which is one of the most popular version control systems in the world. Some projects of the study used svn or some other version control systems before because they have long histories, but they all support git now. We employ JGit, a  lightweight, pure java library implementation of git, to retrieve all the commit logs in projects' histories. A typical commit log contains commit id which is a 20-character-long string uniquely identifying a commit, author, date and message. Once we get a commit id, we use "git show" command to show the log message and textual diff. The diff result contains one or more change files which contain one or more change hunks.

\subsubsection{Classification}
There are many commits which are not concurrent related in the commits which we have collected.  We need to select concurrent related commits. Yuan Tian et al. gave a successful example of identifing bug fixing patches using machine learning\cite{conf/icse/TianLL12}. We use machine learning to train and predict whether a commit is concurrent related. We adopt both text analysis and code analysis to extract features. A commit log uses natural language to present what was changed and why the change was made in most cases. We treat each commit log as a bag of words then match the words to a set of concurrent keywords which we have defined as the Java concurrent keywords like "synchronized", "volatile" and names of common classes or interfaces in Java libraries which are related to concurrency. We also do a code analysis based on the diff result. 12 features are extracted for each commit, which is shown in Table II.

We use the SVM\cite{journals/ml/CortesV95} algorithm to train and classify commits as concurrent-related or not. SVM is a supervised classification algorithm which needs both positive and negative labeled data for training. In our tool, we use an implementation of SVM, LIBSVM\cite{libsvm}. We manually label some data as a training data set first then train a model. The trained classifier selects 135 positive instances from all the commits which we have collected.

\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{Features of data}
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline
		Feature&Explanation\\\hline
		msgKey&Number of keywords in commit message\\\hline
		file&Number of files in a commit\\\hline
		hunk&Number of hunks in a commit\\\hline
		lineAdd&Number of added lines in a commit\\\hline
		lineRemove&Number of removed lines in a commit\\\hline
		lineSub&lineAdd - lineRemove\\\hline
		lineSum&lineAdd + lineRemove\\\hline
		keyAdd&Number of added keywords in a commit\\\hline
		keyRemove&Number of removed keywords in a commit\\\hline
		keySub&keyAdd - keyRemove\\\hline
		keySum&keyAdd + keyRemove\\\hline
		contextKey&Number of keywords in context code\\\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Results}

\subsection{RQ1. How many types of change patterns in concurrent programming?}

\textbf{Taxonomy} There are so many different concurrent related changes in the code history. We divide them into several types according to their properties. Our taxonomy is based on observed behaviour of code changes. It can also be decided by purposes of code changes. But purpose is a subjective concept and it is more difficult to determine why the changes are made. The taxonomy includes change of lock type, change of lock variable, synchronization addition, synchronization removal, lock release, volatile addition, volatile removal, class replacement, thread-safe class replacement, thread management, thread status management, 

We are going to talk about these change types concretely with examples next.

\lstset{language=java, numbers=left, breaklines=true,  basicstyle=\ttfamily\tiny, keywordstyle=\color{blue}\bf\ttfamily, xleftmargin=3em, tabsize=2}

\textbf{Change of lock type}

Lock is a mechanism to synchronize shared resources when multiple threads access them concurrently. A lock usually allows only one thread to gain the lock at a time and then access the shared resources. Java and its standard library provide many different types of locks. Third-party libraries also provide this kind of facilities. Developers need think of which type of lock should be used during the software development and evolution.

Java has a keyword 'synchronized', which can synchronize a block of code as a synchronized block on a monitor object. This keyword can be used to mark both methods and code blocks. It is a special kind of lock for every object has a implicit monitor lock. We do not need to acquire and release locks manually. We do not need to worry about forgetting release locks in a 'finally' block. It is easier for programmers to deal concurrency with 'synchronized' rather than explicit locks.

Although 'synchronized' keyword is convenient and straightforward, we need explicit locks when we have more requirements. Java has ReentrantLock and ReentrantReadWriteLock. ReentrantLock is a reentrant lock, which means a lock can be acquired repeatedly in the same thread. It is a exclusive lock with the similar behaviour as monitor lock but has more features. ReadWriteLock is a pair of locks, which allows concurrent access to read operations when there is no write operation going on but exclusive access to write operations. //todo

This is a commit of YARN-5825 - ProportionalPreemptionalPolicy could use readLock over LeafQueue instead of synchronized block. They think it is a major bug of Hadoop project. They used a synchronized block to synchronize in various places, which can be replaced with a read lock. There are many different locks which can be used to synchronize. A read lock is more lightweight than a synchronized block and it allows multiple threads to read simultaneously and hence improves performance.

\textbf{Change of lock variable}

No matter explicit locks or 'synchronize' keyword, we always need a lock variable to be acquired and released. It is important to choose the right lock variable to use and the order to use more than one lock. There are some best practice like two-phase locking \cite{journals/cacm/EswarranGLT76}, which is a locking method to guarantee serializability. It is usually used in database transaction management. The method is relatively simple to understand. It has two phases: the first is expanding phase where you can only acquire locks and the second is shrinking phase where you can only release locks. You can access data between the two phases.

Use single object (membersLock) for all locking

/**

This is another example. The lock variable is originally the monitor of the object and now is membersLock. They turned to use single object (membersLock) for all locking as the commit message said.

This is a commit of HDFS-4200 - Reduce the size of synchronized sections in PacketResponder. It is a major improvement. The developers said the size of synchronized sections can be reduced. It is always meaningful to remove the unnecessary synchronizations. Over-synchronization \cite{conf/sigsoft/GuJSZL15} is a real issue in real-world software.

[FLINK-2384] [runtime] Move blocking I/O call outside of synchronized block
Problem: Waiting on asynchronous write requests with the partition lock can
result in a deadlock, because all other operations on the same partition are
blocked. It is possible that the I/O writer itself needs to access the
partition, in which cases the whole program blocks.
Solution: Move the wait outside the synchronized block. This was not necessary
before, because no operation assumes the spilling to be finished when the
finish call has returned.

public void finish() throws IOException {
synchronized (buffers) {
if (add(EventSerializer.toBuffer(EndOfPartitionEvent.INSTANCE))) {
-			// If we are spilling/have spilled, wait for the writer to finish.
-			if (spillWriter != null) {
-				spillWriter.close();
-			}
isFinished = true;
}
}
+
+	// If we are spilling/have spilled, wait for the writer to finish.
+	if (spillWriter != null) {
+		spillWriter.close();
+	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

This is an example from flink. It is a critical bug issue "Deadlock during partition spilling". A user reported the problem. The developer wrote a detailed message, which describes the problem, reason and solution.

On the basis that access() and finish() are synchronized, extend synchronization to other methods that access same fields.

return this.accessed;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Release lock}

\textbf{Volatile addition}

Volatile addition is a addition of the volatile keyword. Volatile is a keyword of Java. It is used to mark a variable which should be saved in main memory. Any read or write operation of the variable should visit the main memory instead of only using cache. This provides visibility of the latest value of variable across multiple threads.

Double-checked locking needs to use volatile to be thread-safe
...
-    protected Membership membership = null;
+    protected volatile Membership membership = null;
\end{lstlisting}
It is a commit for bug 58392 in Bugzilla. It is reported by a race detector that there is data race on field. Double checked locking is a synchronization pattern in software engineering. It first check the condition without lock to reduce the time overhead when the condition is not satisfied. A typical usage of it is singleton pattern which uses lazy initialization to provide an unique instance during the process execution time in multi-threaded scenario. But sometimes programmers make some mistakes using this pattern like forgetting 'volatile' modifier of the member of object in Java.

HDFS-4029. GenerationStamp should use an AtomicLong. Contributed by Eli Collins

...
-  private volatile long genstamp;
+  private AtomicLong genstamp = new AtomicLong();
...
-  public synchronized long nextStamp() {
-    this.genstamp++;
-    return this.genstamp;

}
...
\end{lstlisting}

This commit is from hadoop. "..." represents that some code are omitted. It is a fix of issue HDFS-4029 "GenerationStamp should use an AtomicLong" whose priority is major. The code synchronize the method nextStamp for it might be invoked concurrently. Method nextStamp increases genstamp by one and then return it. The developers found that it would be cleaner to use an AtomicLong so that genstamp itself is atomic and they do not have to synchronize the various accesses to it. AtomicLong is a thread-safe version of type long. It allows users to update it atomically without any synchronization. Its internal implementation is not using synchronized method or block. It uses sun.misc.Unsafe which provides many unsafe but fast operations.

}
...
\end{lstlisting}

This commit is from lucene-solr. It is a commit for LUCENE-2779 which is a minor-priority improvement. It is better to use a thread-safe version collection ConcurrentHashMap instead of using HashMap and synchronizing the access code. This thread-safe class not only simplify the way of using a hash map, but also improve the performance compared to manual synchronization like the example. It supports full concurrency of retrievals and high expected concurrency for updates.

HADOOP-11970. Replace uses of ThreadLocal<Random> with JDK7 ThreadLocalRandom (Sean Busbey via Colin P. McCabe)
...
-import java.util.Random;
+import java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom;
...
-  private static ThreadLocal<Random> RANDOM = new ThreadLocal<Random>() {
-    @Override
-    protected Random initialValue() {
-      return new Random();
-    }
-  };
...
-      final double ratio = RANDOM.get().nextDouble() + 0.5;//0.5 <= ratio <=1.5
+      // ensure 0.5 <= ratio <=1.5
+      final double ratio = ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextDouble() + 0.5;
\end{lstlisting}

This example shows a switch from ThreadLocal$<$Random$>$ to ThreadLocalRandom from JDK7. It is of the issue HADOOP-11970 which is a major improvement. This issue says that ThreadLocalRandom should be used when available in place of ThreadLocal<Random>. For JDK7 the difference is minimal, but JDK8 starts including optimizations for ThreadLocalRandom. The ThreadLocal class provides thread-local variables. The ThreadLocalRandom class is a random number generator isolated to the current thread since 1.7.

\subsection{RQ2. How frequent do concurrent related code modification appear in different kinds of Java open-source projects?}

\caption{Number of concurrent related commits compared to all commits}
\end{figure*}

We count the number of concurrent related commits of each month in all the projects of our study. The number of concurrent related commits is relatively small compared to the number of all commits as we can see in Figure 1. The two indexes have a positive correlation generally.

\subsection{RQ3. What is the trend of concurrent programming construct usage statistically?}

\subsection{RQ4. How can these change patterns in history guide the future development?}

\subsection{Threats to Validity}

All the change patterns are summarized from real commits of projects. Different developers may have different taste and preference. Their behavior on similar conditions may be different sometimes contradictory. We indeed find that some changes are contradictory.

Some change patterns are not easy to determine the right occasion to apply especially those concurrency control problems like dead lock, race condition. They usually need rigorous analysis based on the dependent code.

We collect all the commits from the initialization of projects. The time range of them is very wide. Some changes are not very new. The development of software is very fast, so some change patterns which are not very new might not be suitable for the newest software.

\section{Discussion}
We also have some interesting findings in collecting and analyzing the concurrent related code changes.

(1) Some changes are contrary. Different developers may modify their code in an opposite direction.

(2) Developers are using some code-checking tools like findbugs to help them inspect their code.

The examples above show that some developers are using code checking tools like findbugs. But these kind of tools don't help developers correct and eliminate the warnings automatically. One developer in Tomcat said "make the volatile anyway so FindBugs doesn't complain" in the commit log.


(3) 

This research provides some implications from different kinds of perspectives.

(1) Developers are facing more and more concurrent programming requirements now. But concurrent programming is notoriously error-prone because of the complexity of data synchronization and thread interleaving. Our study gives developers some guidelines of writing concurrent programs. First, use handy concurrent libraries to finish the job instead of rewrite them by yourself unless all the available concurrent libraries cannot satisfy your requirement and you are absolutely confident of your comcurrent programming skills. Using existing libraries allows you to  write less code to finish the same work and enjoy the high quality of implementation which is always reliable, strong and fast. Second, always switch to new-version libraries because they usually provide higher performance and robustness.

(2) Automatic tools are needed to help developers inspect and revise concurrent programs with the help of history information. There has already been some tools, but they usually look for concurrent bugs such as race detection, deadlock detection and atomicity violation without considering software evolution history. Both project specific and project independent transformation patterns exist in real-world software projects. So we need some concurrent code refactoring tools to give advice of what code need change and perform the transformations automatically. It is a chance for IDE manufacturer to make the IDE more intelligent in inspecting and modifying the code. Developers will benefit a lot if such kind of automatic tools can actually help them automate their development and maintaining activities.
