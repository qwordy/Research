\textbf{Empirical studies on concurrent programming.} In literature, researchers have conducted various empirical studies to understand concurrent programming. \cite{journals/jss/PintoTFFB15} conducted a large scale study on the usage of concurrency in Java, and Wu \textit{et al}. \cite{journals/infsof/WuCZX16} replicated their study with C++. Okur and Dig \cite{conf/sigsoft/OkurD12} studied how developers use parallel libraries in C\#, and their results reveal some interesting findings. For example, at least 10\% of programmers misuse libraries, so their code runs sequentially rather than concurrently. David \textit{et al}. \cite{conf/sosp/DavidGT13} conducted an empirical study to investigate synchronization at both hardware and software levels, and their results show that the scalability of synchronization is mainly a property of hardware. Pinto \textit{et al}. \cite{conf/oopsla/PintoTC15} analyze concurrency-related threads of StackOverflow, and they found that most threads discussed basic questions (\emph{e.g.}, ``what is a mutex?''). Sadowski \textit{et al}. \cite{conf/msr/SadowskiYK12} studied the evolution of data races, and they found that many data races always exist. Xin \textit{et al}. \cite{conf/icsm/XinQHXZWG13} conducted an empirical study on lock usage, and they found that most functions acquire only a lock. Lu \textit{et al}. \cite{conf/asplos/LuPSZ08} studied characteristics of real world concurrency bugs. The above approaches do not analyze change patterns and the trends of parallel APIs, which is complemented by our study.

\textbf{Program transformation.} Many studies have been conducted to understand program transformation and to transform programs automatically. Okur \textit{et al}. \cite{conf/ecoop/OkurED14} studied 880 open-source C\# projects and found that converting code from low-level to high-leveler parallel abstractions is tedious and error-prone. They presented two refactoring tools to help developers with the migration. Lin \textit{et al}. \cite{conf/sigsoft/LinRD14} studied 104 open-source applications to understand how AsyncTask is used, underused and misused in practice. They found that hundreds of places have the chances to apply AsyncTask and nearly half of the refactoring is done manually. They presented Asynchronizer, a refactoring tool which can extract code into AsyncTask automatically. Meng \textit{et al}. \cite{conf/pldi/MengKM11} presented Sydit, a tranformation tool which can tranform programs from examples. Sydit can make the similar edits to what human make on 70\% (39/56) cases.
