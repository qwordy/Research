\section{Conclusion}
We conduct a study on change patterns in concurrent programming. We select concurrent related commits by textual analysis and machine learning. We examine the code changes to understand what the changes are and why they change. We identify some change patterns and establish a taxonomy of these change patterns. The most common types of change patterns are changing critical sections, adding or removing \texttt{volatile} and thread-safe class replacement. We also find some interesting findings.
