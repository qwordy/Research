%\noindent
%\textbf{The causes of reverted commits.} We find that programmers can revert a previous change in the follow-up commits. For example,
%
%
%\zhong{List the previous commit:}
%
%\zhong{Explain the commit}
%
%However, in a follow-up commit, we find that the above commit is reverted as follow:
%
%
%\begin{lstlisting}
%commit f5fab1f64ba11e04e52bd6251ca62fc854e9578c
%Whoops. Fix regression in r1724015.
%Code was used although I can't see why a simple AtomicInteger wasn't sufficient.
%
%+    private final AtomicInteger aprPoolDestroyed = new AtomicInteger(0);
%-    private static final AtomicIntegerFieldUpdater<OpenSSLContext> DESTROY_UPDATER = AtomicIntegerFieldUpdater.newUpdater(OpenSSLContext.class, "aprPoolDestroyed");
%\end{lstlisting}
%
%\zhong{Explain the above commit.}
%\zhong{Explain why programmers revert the commit, why it matters?}

\noindent
\textbf{The causes of contradicted commits.} We find that programmers can make seemingly contradicted commits. For example, we find the following commit\footnote{\url{https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/f5fab1f64ba11e04e52bd6251ca62fc854e9578c}} from Cassandra:

%id: 95, 250
\begin{lstlisting}
-private final AtomicInteger references = new AtomicInteger(1);
+private volatile int references = 1;
+private static final AtomicIntegerFieldUpdater<RefCountedMemory> UPDATER = AtomicIntegerFieldUpdater.newUpdater(RefCountedMemory.class, "references");
...
-  int n = references.get();
+  int n = UPDATER.get(this);
...
-  if (references.compareAndSet(n, n + 1))
+  if (UPDATER.compareAndSet(this, n, n + 1))
...
-  if (references.decrementAndGet() == 0)
+  if (UPDATER.decrementAndGet(this) == 0)
\end{lstlisting}

The above commit replaces the \CodeIn{AtomicInteger} class with the \CodeIn{Ato\-mic\-Integer\-Field\-Updater} class, since its programmer believe that it saves memory. Meanwhile, we find that a commit\footnote{\url{https://github.com/apache/cassandra/commit/7918718c8ce53c6d0958aa969fc813e586463d08}} from Tomcat made the contradicted change:

\begin{lstlisting}
-private static final AtomicIntegerFieldUpdater<OpenSSLContext> DESTROY_UPDATER = AtomicIntegerFieldUpdater.newUpdater(OpenSSLContext.class, "aprPoolDestroyed");
+private final AtomicInteger aprPoolDestroyed = new AtomicInteger(0);
...
-  if (DESTROY_UPDATER.compareAndSet(this, 0, 1))
+  if (aprPoolDestroyed.compareAndSet(0, 1))
\end{lstlisting}

The programmer of the above commit explains that the \CodeIn{AtomicInteger} class is sufficient. Different programmers have different opinions. In future work, we plan to conduct surveys to fully understand the rationale behind their choices.

\noindent
\textbf{The extension of existing tools.} Our patterns and findings can help improving existing program transformation tools. For example,  Lin \emph{et al.}~\cite{conf/sigsoft/LinRD14} propose Asynchronizer that transforms self-written code with the \CodeIn{AsyncTask} class. Our study finds self-written code snippets that can be replaced with other parallel API classes. With minor modifications, we can extend Asynchronizer to transform self-written code to more APIs. We plan to explore such extension in future work.

\noindent
\textbf{The usefulness of our other findings.} In our empirical study, we reveal the usefulness of our change patterns, but we did not explore the benefits of our other findings. We believe that our other findings can also be useful in specific scenarios. For example, the trend of a specific class can have correlations with other factors such as the changes inside APIs. In future work, we plan to explore such factors, so that we can explore the usefulness of our other findings.
