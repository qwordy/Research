\section{Discussion and Future Work}
\noindent
\textbf{The causes of reverted commits.} We find that programmers can revert a previous change in the follow-up commits. For example,


\zhong{List the previous commit:}

\zhong{Explain the commit}

However, in a follow-up commit, we find that the above commit is reverted as follow: 


\begin{lstlisting}
commit f5fab1f64ba11e04e52bd6251ca62fc854e9578c
Whoops. Fix regression in r1724015.
Code was used although I can't see why a simple AtomicInteger wasn't sufficient.

+    private final AtomicInteger aprPoolDestroyed = new AtomicInteger(0);
-    private static final AtomicIntegerFieldUpdater<OpenSSLContext> DESTROY_UPDATER = AtomicIntegerFieldUpdater.newUpdater(OpenSSLContext.class, "aprPoolDestroyed");
\end{lstlisting}

\zhong{Explain the above commit.}
\zhong{Explain why programmers revert the commit, why it matters?}

\noindent
\textbf{The extension of existing tools.} \zhong{Explain how to improve existing tools with your findings. Discuss how to implement a tool that, for example, that can replace self-written code with existing parallel APIs. }
